# Audio Capture Enhancement Documentation

## Overview
This document explains the enhanced audio capture functionality implemented in the Buuzzr Interview Assistant extension. The enhancements include:

1. Improved system audio capture from tabs
2. Better transcription display in the AI helper window
3. Automatic audio permission requests
4. Visual feedback for audio activity

## Key Features

### 1. Enhanced System Audio Capture
The extension now properly captures system audio from tabs using Chrome's `tabCapture` API with improved configuration:

- Audio constraints optimized for interview scenarios
- Echo cancellation and noise suppression enabled
- Continuous audio chunk processing (2-second intervals)
- Better error handling and recovery

### 2. Improved Transcription Display
The AI helper window now displays transcriptions in a WhatsApp-style chat interface:

- Interviewer audio on the left (gray bubbles)
- User microphone audio on the right (blue bubbles)
- AI responses in the center (orange bubbles)
- Timestamps for all messages
- Auto-scrolling to newest messages

### 3. Automatic Audio Permission Handling
The extension automatically requests audio permissions when starting the AI helper:

- Visual indicators for permission status
- Error handling for denied permissions
- Success notifications when audio capture starts

### 4. Audio Activity Visualization
Real-time feedback when audio is detected:

- Visual indicator when interviewer audio is captured
- Automatic hiding after periods of inactivity
- Size reporting for audio chunks

## Implementation Details

### Background Script (`background.js`)
- Enhanced `captureSystemAudio` message handler with better error handling
- Improved MediaRecorder configuration for continuous processing
- Added `requestTabAudio` message handler for permission requests
- Better state management for capture sessions

### Content Script (`content-script.js`)
- Added visual indicators for audio permission requests
- Implemented `requestAudioPermission` message handler
- Added success/error notifications for audio capture

### AI Helper Window (`ai-helper-window/inject-overlay.js`)
- Enhanced transcription display with WhatsApp-style chat bubbles
- Added audio activity indicators
- Improved UI updates for audio capture status
- Better handling of interim and final transcription results

### Popup (`popup.js`)
- Modified `startAIHelper` to automatically request audio permissions
- Added 2-second delay to ensure proper initialization

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Load the extension in Chrome
2. Open the test page (`test-audio-capture.html`)
3. Click "Start Audio Capture"
4. Play audio in another tab
5. Observe transcription output
6. Click "Stop Audio Capture" when finished

### Automated Testing
The extension includes mock transcription data for testing purposes. In a production environment, this would be replaced with actual speech-to-text service integration.

## Permissions Required
- `tabCapture`: For capturing system audio from tabs
- `desktopCapture`: For screen sharing (existing)
- `microphone`: For user microphone input (existing)

## Troubleshooting

### No Audio Detected
1. Ensure the tab being captured actually has audio playing
2. Check that audio permissions were granted
3. Verify that the meeting platform is supported (Google Meet, Zoom, Teams)

### Transcription Not Displaying
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that the AI helper window is properly injected
3. Ensure the content script is running on the meeting page

### Permission Errors
1. Make sure all required permissions are listed in `manifest.json`
2. Check that the user granted all requested permissions
3. Verify that the extension is properly loaded

## Future Improvements
1. Integration with cloud-based speech-to-text services (Google Speech-to-Text, Azure Speech Services)
2. Support for additional meeting platforms
3. Multi-language transcription support
4. Audio quality enhancement algorithms
5. Offline transcription capabilities using WebAssembly libraries
