# STT Integration Summary

## Implemented Features

### 1. Screen Sharing & System Audio Capture
- **Location**: Screen button in left sidebar
- **Functionality**: 
  - Opens Google Meet-style screen picker using `navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia()`
  - Captures system audio from selected tab/window
  - Runs continuous Speech-to-Text on system audio
  - Adds transcripts as "Interviewer" messages in chat

### 2. User Microphone Capture  
- **Location**: Mic button in left sidebar & camera button in bottom bar
- **Functionality**:
  - Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({ audio: true })`
  - Runs continuous Speech-to-Text on user microphone
  - Adds transcripts as "User" messages in chat

### 3. WhatsApp-Style Chat Interface
- **User messages**: Right-aligned green bubbles
- **Interviewer messages**: Left-aligned white bubbles  
- **AI/System messages**: Center-aligned blue bubbles
- **Each bubble includes**: Speaker label, timestamp, message text
- **Auto-scroll**: Automatically scrolls to newest messages

### 4. Responsive Design
- **Desktop** (1400px+): Full 3-panel layout
- **Tablet** (1024px-1400px): Stacked layout with horizontal sidebar
- **Mobile** (768px-): Full-screen single column layout
- **Adaptive elements**: Navigation, chat bubbles, input controls

### 5. Real-time Status Indicators
- **Visual feedback**: Active buttons highlighted in orange
- **Status badges**: Show screen/mic active states
- **Dynamic placeholders**: Input changes based on capture state
- **Empty state**: Shows status when no transcriptions yet

## File Changes Made

### 1. ExtensionWindow.jsx
- Added state management for screen sharing and microphone
- Implemented speech recognition for both system and user audio
- Added WhatsApp-style chat bubble rendering
- Enhanced responsive component structure
- Added automatic screen sharing prompt on startup

### 2. styles.css
- Added chat bubble styles (user, interviewer, ai types)
- Implemented responsive breakpoints and layouts
- Added status indicator and badge styles
- Enhanced navigation active states
- Added screen picker modal styles

### 3. popup.js
- Modified `startAIHelper()` to trigger screen sharing
- Added popup close after AI Helper starts
- Enhanced session management

### 4. inject-overlay.js
- Integrated screen sharing and microphone functionality
- Added Speech-to-Text initialization and management
- Implemented WhatsApp-style chat rendering
- Added responsive navigation handling
- Enhanced user interaction feedback

## How It Works

1. **User clicks "Start AI Helper"** → Opens screen picker automatically
2. **User selects screen/tab** → Begins system audio capture + STT
3. **User can toggle microphone** → Begins user audio capture + STT  
4. **All speech is transcribed** → Appears as chat bubbles in real-time
5. **Responsive design adapts** → Works on all screen sizes
6. **State is managed consistently** → UI updates reflect capture status

## Technical Implementation

- **Speech Recognition**: Uses Web Speech API (`SpeechRecognition`)
- **Media Capture**: Uses WebRTC APIs (`getDisplayMedia`, `getUserMedia`)
- **State Management**: React hooks + vanilla JS for overlay
- **Responsive**: CSS Grid/Flexbox with media queries
- **Real-time Updates**: Event-driven UI updates with automatic scrolling

The implementation provides a seamless interview assistance experience with professional real-time transcription capabilities and an intuitive chat-based interface.
